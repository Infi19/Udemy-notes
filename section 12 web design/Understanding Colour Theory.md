# ðŸŒˆ Understanding Colour Theory

## ðŸ“– Overview

**Colour Theory** is the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color and the visual effects of how colors mix, match, or contrast with each other. In design, it's used to create aesthetics, evoke emotions, and build visual hierarchy.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- **The Colour Wheel:** A visual representation of color relationships.
    
    - **Primary Colours:** Red, Yellow, Blue (RYB) - Cannot be created by mixing other colors.
        
    - **Secondary Colours:** Green, Orange, Purple - Created by mixing two primary colors.
        
    - **Tertiary Colours:** Made by mixing a primary and a secondary color.
        
- **Colour Models:**
    
    - **RGB (Additive):** Red, Green, Blue. Used for digital screens. Colors are "added" together to create white.
        
    - **CMYK (Subtractive):** Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black). Used for print. Colors are "subtracted" from white.
        
- **Colour Properties (HSV/HSB):**
    
    - **Hue:** The pure color itself (e.g., "red," "blue").
        
    - **Saturation:** The intensity or purity of the hue (from 0% gray to 100% pure).
        
    - **Value (or Brightness):** How light or dark the hue is (from 0% black to 100% white).
        

## ðŸŽ¨ Colour Harmonies (Schemes)

These are time-tested combinations that are pleasing to the eye.

- **Monochromatic:** Uses variations (tints, tones, shades) of a single hue. Creates a clean, elegant look.
    
- **Analogous:** Uses colors that are adjacent on the color wheel. Harmonious and serene.
    
- **Complementary:** Uses colors opposite each other on the wheel (e.g., Blue & Orange). High-contrast and vibrant.
    
- **Triadic:** Uses three evenly spaced colors on the wheel. Creates a balanced, high-energy palette.
    
- **Tetradic (Double-Complementary):** Uses two pairs of complementary colors. Rich, but can be hard to balance.
    

## ðŸš€ Practical Application

- **60-30-10 Rule:** A classic design rule for balancing color.
    
    - **60%:** Dominant/Main color (e.g., walls).
        
    - **30%:** Secondary color (e.g., furniture).
        
    - **10%:** Accent color (e.g., cushions, call-to-action buttons).
        
- **Psychology of Colour:** Colors evoke specific feelings.
    
    - **Blue:** Trust, security, calm (common for banks, tech).
        
    - **Red:** Passion, urgency, danger (common for sales, warnings).
        
    - **Green:** Nature, growth, wealth, "go" (common for health, environment).
        
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background for readability.
