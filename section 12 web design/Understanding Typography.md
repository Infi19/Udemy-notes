# ‚úíÔ∏è 70. Understanding Typography

## üìñ Overview

**Typography** is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. It's a critical component of ui that sets the product's tone and guides the user.

## üí° Key Concepts

- **Typeface vs. Font:**
    
    - **Typeface:** The design _family_ (e.g., "Roboto", "Helvetica").
        
    - **Font:** A specific _variation_ within that family (e.g., "Roboto Bold 16pt").
        
- **Font Categories:**
    
    - **Serif:** Have small strokes (serifs) at the ends of letterforms (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).
        
        - _Use:_ Excellent for readability in long-form body text (books, articles).
            
    - **Sans-Serif:** Lack serifs (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Roboto).
        
        - _Use:_ Clean, modern. Great for headlines, digital screens, and UIs.
            
    - **Script:** Imitates handwriting or calligraphy.
        
    - **Display:** Highly stylized, decorative fonts. Best for large headlines, not body text.
        

## üìê Typographic Elements

- **Hierarchy:** Using size, weight (e.g., bold), and color to create a clear informational structure. This tells the user what to read first (e.g., `<h1>` > `<h2>` > `<p>`).
    
- **Leading (Line Height):** The vertical space between lines of text. Adequate leading (e.g., 1.4x - 1.6x font size) drastically improves readability.
    
- **Tracking (Letter Spacing):** The overall spacing between characters in a block of text.
    
- **Kerning:** The spacing between _two specific characters_ (e.g., adjusting the space between 'A' and 'V').
    
- **Line Length:** The width of a block of text. For optimal readability, aim for **50-75 characters** per line.
    

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Limit Typefaces:** Use 2-3 at most (e.g., one for headings, one for body text) to avoid visual chaos.
    
- **Prioritize Readability:** The primary goal is always clarity.
    
- **Font Pairing:** When using two typefaces, choose ones that contrast yet complement each other (e.g., a sans-serif heading with a serif body).
    
- **Use Whitespace:** Don't crowd your text. Whitespace guides the eye and improves comprehension.
