# ðŸŽ¨ Introduction to Web Design

## ðŸ“– Overview

**Web Design** encompasses the planning, conceptualizing, and arranging of content intended for the internet. It's a multidisciinary field that merges visual aesthetics ([[User Experience (UX) Design]]) with functionality and information architecture ([[User Experience (UX) Design]]).

Why itâ€™s important ðŸš€

- **First Impressions:** A website is often the first point of contact. Good design builds credibility and trust.
    
- **Usability:** A well-designed site guides users to their goals without friction.
    
- **Conversion:** Good design directly impacts user engagement and business goals (e.g., sales, sign-ups).
    

## ðŸ’¡ Key Components

- **Layout & Composition:** How elements are arranged. Key concepts include:
    
    - **Grid Systems:** Provide structure and consistency.
        
    - **Whitespace (Negative Space):** Gives elements room to breathe and reduces cognitive load.
        
    - **Visual Hierarchy:** Making important elements stand out. 
        
- **Colour:** Sets the mood, evokes emotion, and guides attention. [[Understanding Colour Theory]]
    
- **Typography:** The art of arranging text to be readable, legible, and visually appealing. [[Understanding Typography]]
    
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website looks and functions well on all devices (desktops, tablets, phones) using techniques like [[Media Queries]] and flexible grids.
    

## ðŸ”„ Design vs. Development

Web design and web development are two distinct but highly collaborative roles.
