# 🚀 User Experience (UX) Design

## 📖 Overview

**User Experience (UX) Design** is the holistic _process_ of designing products (digital or physical) that are useful, usable, and delightful to interact with. It goes beyond visuals (`[[71. User Interface (UI) Design]]`) to encompass the user's entire journey and feeling.

🔥 **UX is the _journey_; UI is the _touchpoints_.** A beautiful app (**UI**) that is confusing to use is bad **UX**.

## honeycomb Peter Morville's UX Honeycomb

A good UX is:

- **Useful:** Solves a real user problem.
    
- **Usable:** Easy to use, learnable.
    
- **Desirable:** Visually appealing, creates an emotional connection.
    
- **Findable:** Users can easily locate information.
    
- **Accessible:** Usable by people of all abilities. `[[Web Accessibility (a11y)]]`
    
- **Credible:** Users trust the product and information.
    

## 🔄 The UX Design Process

UX design is a problem-solving framework, often visualized as the "Double Diamond" from `[[Design Thinking]]`.

## 💡 Key Deliverables & Methods

- **User Research:** The foundation. Includes surveys, interviews, and observing users to understand their needs, behaviors, and pain points.
    
- **User Personas:** Fictional, archetypal profiles of your target users based on research. Helps the team build empathy.
    
- **User Journey Maps:** Visualizes the step-by-step experience a user has with your product, including their actions, thoughts, and emotions.
    
- **Wireframes:** Low-fidelity, basic blueprints of the app or site. Focuses on structure and flow, not visual design.
    
- **Prototypes:** Clickable, interactive mockups that simulate the final product. Used for `[[Usability Testing]]`.
    
- **Usability Testing:** Observing real users as they try to complete tasks with your prototype. The goal is to identify friction points and fix them.
